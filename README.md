This is an open-source Discord Nitro Generator written in Python! Please Do Not Copy, unless you Credit! **(Discontinued)**
## Features
+ Nitro Code Generation, amount you choice!
+ Nitro Code Checking while Generating.

+ Discord Webhook (Valid Codes get posted straight to a Discord Webhook!)
## Installation
+ GitHub 
```

Then Run the new file

You may need to disable your antivirus as it may suspect "suspicious activity" as it often calls the discord API to check the code (i solve this problem).
```
and you should be good to go!

You MUST Have The Latest Version of Python installed (recommended). I Am not sure how smoothly or if it would run at all on other versions!
